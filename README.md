This is an attempt at making a stack simple enough for a farmer, volenteer or other small business to write something useful for managing the many tasks they deal with on a daily basis. My aim is to come up with a nice representation for representing the answer to lot's of simple problems. Ya I know... but I'm gonna try. Feel free to make suggestions and send code reviews.

Also I am working with https://biddefordcommunitygardens.org to develope a small farm on a 3 acre rehabilitated dump. I thought it would be useful to have a tool where I could create a task and the group of volenteers could go to there phone and signup for the task on the priority queue.

One thing that would be useful is a seed organizer where I could write a number written on a capsule of seeds and link it to all the data for that seed and possibly linked to a local seed exchange. I included some 'seed' data which I spidered from a local seed company. That may will help you get started.

I was thinking it would be nice to have dashboard that could pick a few workflows from a default set.

Anyway, I think the name says it all. I am hoping to bridge the gap between technology and comunity.

It's all a little raw but one day I will delete this sentence.
