This is an attempt at making a stack simple enough for a farmer, volunteer or other small business to write something useful for managing the many tasks they deal with on a daily basis. My aim is to come up with a nice representation for representing the answer to some simple problems we face at a CSA. Feel free to make suggestions and send code reviews. This is sort of a reach goal for me so I am gonna remain humble. I've made some attempt a documenting what I've done so far. It's very rough.

Also I am working with https://biddefordcommunitygardens.org to develop a small farm on a 3 acre rehabilitated dump. I thought it would be useful to have a tool where I could create a task and the group of volunteers could go to there phone and sign up for the task on the priority queue.

One thing that would be useful is a seed organizer where I could write a number written on a capsule of seeds and link it to all the data for that seed and possibly linked to a local seed exchange. I included some 'seed' data which I spidered from a local seed company. That may will help you get started.

I was thinking it would be nice to have dashboard that could pick a few workflows from a default set.

Anyway, I think the name says it all. I am hoping to bridge the gap between technology and community. I make no claims to be up to the task so if anyone has design suggestions or wants to fork and show me how to do something better that is part of the fun.

It's all a little raw but one day I will delete this sentence.
