The purpose of this project is to provide useful tools for volunteer organization, seed exchanges, small farms, and small businesses.

[![Here is a short video to give a sense of what we will be building.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12137736/112363149-8eeb1780-8cab-11eb-8a82-20c0fe273cf4.mp4)

The basic story goes as follows. I maintain a hobby farm, help plan for https://biddefordcommunitygardens.org. By now I have noticed a few things have become unmanagable. First, I have too many seeds and organizing them is difficult. So, I started numbering my seed packets so I can use my computer to organize and reference them by ID. Also, Biddeford Community Gardens has a lot of projects and a lot of volunteers. So the Plan tab let's us lay out a plan like a dependency tree. Prioritize will use the dependency tree to to determine which chores need doing first. The video above for the desktop app but we will also have Mobile so volunteers can see if work is needed at any of the community gardens.
