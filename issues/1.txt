?Why are we not seeing model.Seeds update?
    Let's see if we are running the task in gradle.
        Yes, I can run and debug.
    My hunch is FileBuilder is writing to the wrong place in *Generator.kt
       I searched for it in build file
       I checked my run configurations

?Why is DTOGenerator not generating?
    It was not specified in: buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/ModelGenerator.kt

Brought back find_shit.py life_organizer in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/generators/Generator.kt
Confirmed that things work
TODO: Create data for the get to retrieve.
TODO: Retrieve the data through API and Exposed
TODO: Checkout "Reactive Streams" in IntelliJ
TODO: Switch model from snakecase to camelCase

?Why is the chore table not created?
    It is not loading because it breaks when loading chores.json.
    It Now loads and looks like this:
        exposed=> select * from chore;
         id | parentId | childrenIds | name 
        ----+----------+-------------+------
          1 |       -1 | 1,3         | A
          2 |        0 | 2           | B
          3 |        1 |             | C
          4 |        0 |             | D
        (4 rows)
    I will now disable the reloading of the tables in SeedsDbManager.
