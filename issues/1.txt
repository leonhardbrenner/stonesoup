?Why are we not seeing model.Seeds update?
    Let's see if we are running the task in gradle.
        Yes, I can run and debug.
    My hunch is FileBuilder is writing to the wrong place in *Generator.kt
       I searched for it in build file
       I checked my run configurations

?Why is DTOGenerator not generating?
    It was not specified in: buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/ModelGenerator.kt

Brought back find_shit.py life_organizer in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/generators/Generator.kt
Confirmed that things work
Created data for the get to retrieve.
Retrieved the data through API and Exposed

?Why is the chore table not created?
    It is not loading because it breaks when loading chores.json.
    It Now loads and looks like this:
        exposed=> select * from chore;
         id | parentId | childrenIds | name 
        ----+----------+-------------+------
          1 |       -1 | 1,3         | A
          2 |        0 | 2           | B
          3 |        1 |             | C
          4 |        0 |             | D
        (4 rows)
    I will now disable the reloading of the tables in SeedsDbManager.

TODO: Checkout "Reactive Streams" in IntelliJ
TODO: Switch model from snakecase to camelCase

I got IDs working in.
    
Handle childrenIds serialization using split and join for now.
Changed the PlanPrioritizeApplication.get to get data from postgress.
Got add, update, delete to work then delete all the old Mongo stuff.

TODO: Introduce DAO tests.
TODO: Introduce Service tests.

Change git authentication: https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations

TODO: Although, I have added support for id I need to add support to not have it like in the example of Flat. I think
it is as simple as changing the mixin from IntEntity to just Entity.
