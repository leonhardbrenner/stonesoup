?Why are we not seeing model.Seeds update?
    Let's see if we are running the task in gradle.
        Yes, I can run and debug.
    My hunch is FileBuilder is writing to the wrong place in *Generator.kt
       I searched for it in build file
       I checked my run configurations.

?Why is DTOGenerator not generating?
    It was not specified in: buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/ModelGenerator.kt

Brought back find_shit.py life_organizer in buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/generators/Generator.kt
Confirmed that things work
