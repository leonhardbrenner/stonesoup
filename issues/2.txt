Plan scheduling.
     Add scheduling to the FE and wire to new table
         x First wire new table and get some fixture data for schedule
         x Implement the get so the data in the table is available in the FE
         o Send the schedule in the POST
         o Send the schedule in the PUT
         o Handle schedule in POST
         o Handle schedule in PUT
         o Implement some editor changes to support our schedule.
     Start by handling everything using queries on demand
     Wire Quartz scheduler. Note: this is probably a later task.
